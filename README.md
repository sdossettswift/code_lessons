# code_lessons

As a newly minted software developer, I am constantly learning and applying new knowledge. Every day. In Ruby, Rails, JS, Ember, Cordova, etc. This repository is a way for me to commit the knowledge to memory, make sure I understand it, and provide my future self with the documentation I might need down the line.

All of my sandbox exploration is valuable, so long as I capture it. :)

To add a subject to the Readme via command line, use:

` echo '-topic'  >> README.md
`


Topics Covered:
- Environment Variables
- Mail Interceptor
- Sidekiq
- Print screen in rails app
